    b. And what if there are dynamic number of parameters, print all the parameters.

2. Assume you have training data and test data stored as files, use spark to train a machine learning model, and make predictions
    a. After you get a model, how to get all the evaluation parameters of a machine learning model, like f-measure, precision, recall, any numeric data that can measure a machine learning model.
    b. Output all the parameters as a json file, output the path you stored the json file.
	
3. Try different machine learning model, assuming you have the data
    a. This should be easy after you finish the first two tasks
